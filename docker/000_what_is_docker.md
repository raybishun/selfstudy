# What is Docker?
- Docker is used to ensure software will always run regardless of the server hardware and OS
- A Docker image includes all dependencies
- Server --> Host OS --> Running the Docker Engine --> hosting containers that run Docker Apps
- Dockerfile --> use to build an IMAGE --> the image runs in a CONTAINER
- Anyone can download the image and run in their container
