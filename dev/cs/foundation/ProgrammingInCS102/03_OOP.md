# Four Pillars of Object-oriented programming
1. Abstraction
2. Polymorphism
3. Inheritance
4. Encapsulation

### Abstraction

### Polymorphism

### Inheritance

### Encapsulation


#### Abstract Classes
- Helps to facilitate inheritance
- Abstract classes CANNOT be instantiated (as such, serve as base classes)
- Can have normal members, i.e. Properties and Methods
