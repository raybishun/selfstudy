# Four Pillars of Object-oriented programming
1. Abstraction
2. Polymorphism
3. Inheritance
4. Encapsulation

### Abstraction

### Polymorphism

### Inheritance

### Encapsulation

#### Abstract Classes
- Help to facilitate inheritance
- Abstract classes CANNOT be instantiated (as such, serve as base classes)
- Can have normal members, i.e. Properties and Methods
- Can have both abstract and non-abstract methods

### Sealed Classes
- A class we do not want inherited
