# Understanding Operators

### Operators
- Are used to evaluate/manipulate one or more operands in an expression or statement

### Operands
- The object(s) being evaluated/manipulated

### Types of Operators
- Unary (1 operand)
- Binary (2 operands)
- Ternary (3 operands)
- Relational
- Equality
- Shift

### Unary Operators
- +x (Identity)
- -x (Negation)
- !x (Logical negation)
- ~x (Bitwise negation)
- ++x (Pre-increment)
- --x (Pre-decrement)

### Relational Operators
- <
- >
- <=
- >=

### Equality Operators
- == is equal to
- != is not equal to

### Shift Operators (for use with binary bits)
- <<
- >>

### Logical, Conditional & Null Operators
- | (logical OR)
- || (conditional OR, aka short-circuiting logical OR operator)
- & (logical AND)
- && (conditional AND)
- ^ (logical XOR, aka bitwise exclusive OR)
- ?? (null coalescing)
- ?: (ternary operator)
