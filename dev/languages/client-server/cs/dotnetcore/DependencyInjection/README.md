# Depdency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### Basic Explaination of DIP
- Part of the SOLID Design Pattern
- States that high-level modules will not reply on lower-level modules
- Rather, both should depend on abstractions
- And abstractions do not reply on details
- However, details will be governed by abstractions

### Implementation of DIP
- In C#, Interfaces are used to implement abstractions
