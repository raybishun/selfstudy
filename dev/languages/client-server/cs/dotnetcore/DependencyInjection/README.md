# Depdency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### Basic Explanation of DIP
- DIP is part of the SOLID Design Pattern
- States that high-level modules should not reply on lower-level modules
- Rather, both should rely on abstractions
- Abstractions do not reply on lower-level modules
- However, lower-level modules will rely on abstractions

### Implementation of DIP
- In C#, Interfaces are used to implement abstractions
