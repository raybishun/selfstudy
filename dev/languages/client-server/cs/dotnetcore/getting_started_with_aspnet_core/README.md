# Getting Started with ASP.NET Core

### ASP.NET Core Web Application
- Project templates to create ASP.NET Core web apps and web APIs for Windows, Linux and macOS using .NET Core or .NET Framework. Create web apps with Razor Pages, MVC, or Single Page Apps (SPA) using Angular, React, or Rect + Redux.

### Blazor App
- Project templates for creating Blazor apps that run on the server in an ASP.NET Core app, or in the browser on WebAssembly(wasm), aka Blazor Client. These templates can be used to build web apps with rich dynamic user interfaces (UIs).

### Types of Blazor Apps
1. Blazor Server App
2. Blazor WebAssembly App (aka Blazor Client)

### Apps that run 100% on the Client
1. Blazor Client (aka Blazor WebAssembly)
2. Angular (created by Google)
3. React (created by Facebook)
4. Vue.js

### What we're going to build
1. ASP.NET Core Razor Pages
2. ASP.NET Core MVC
3. ASP.NET Core API
4. ASP.NET Core Blazor Server Side
5. ASP.NET Core Blazor Web Assembly

### NuGet Packages used in our .NET Core Class Library
1. Dapper (high performance Micro-ORM created by the folks that run StackOverflow)
2. Microsoft.data.sqlclient (allows you to connect to Microsoft SQL Server)
3. Microsoft.extensions.configuration (used to access appsettings.json, i.e. to read the database connection string)
