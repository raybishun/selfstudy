# Four Pillars of Object-oriented programming
1. Abstraction
2. Polymorphism
3. Inheritance
4. Encapsulation

### Abstraction

### Polymorphism

### Inheritance

### Encapsulation

#### Abstract Classes
- Help to facilitate inheritance
- Abstract classes CANNOT be INSTANTIATED (as such, serve as base classes)
- Can have normal members, i.e. Properties and Methods
- Can have both abstract and non-abstract methods
- Implementation: <Class Access Modifier> abstract class <ClassName> {}

#### Sealed Classes
- A class we do not want INHERITED
- Implementation: <Class Access Modifier> sealed class <ClassName> {}

#### Two Type of Polymorphism
1. Compile-Time (static) - method overloading (same method name, but different signatures)
2. Runtime - overriding virtual methods
