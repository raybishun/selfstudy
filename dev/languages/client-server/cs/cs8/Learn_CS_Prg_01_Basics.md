# The Basics

### C# is a programming language that is...
- Object-oriented
-Imperative
- Declarative
- Functional
- Generic
- Dynamic

### CLI Intro
- Common Language Infrastructure
- Is an open specification developed by Microsoft
- Standardized by the ISO and ECMA

### C#8 Introduces
- Nullable reference types
- Ranges and indices
- Asynchronous streams
- Default implementations of interface members
- Recursive patterns
- Switch expressions 
- And many moreâ€¦

### History of C#
- C# 1.0 was born January 2002
- ...
- C# 8.0 released September 2019 specifically targeting .NET Core 3.0

### NOTE: C#8 not fully compatible with .NET Framework
- Although C#8 can be used with the .NET Framework, it's actually not fully compatible, so best to only use .NET Core with C# going forward

### The CLI (Common Language Infrastructure)
- Encapulates the Common Intermediate Language (CIL) and the Common Language Runtime (CLR)
- Common Language Specfiication (CLS) specifies that languages, i.e. C#, F#, and VB.NET to be compilied/executed on any Operating System in a single runtime
- CLS also specifies there needs to be a common set of data types that the langues must all support (aka Common Type System)

### Implementations of the CLI
1. .NET Framework
2. .NET Core
3. Mono
4. Xamarin
