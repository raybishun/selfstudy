# Compilers and Interpreters

### Compilation
- Lexical analysis (lexing) - classify each token (each word)
- Syntax Analysis (parsing) - applies rules of the language
- Semantic Analysis - syntax checks
- Optimization - breaks down syntax sugar
- Code Generation - compile code based on hardware platform

### Interpreters
- Parses and may execute code
- Or the code is compiled into IL (or bytecode) then executed in a VM
- *** Python actually runs code in a VM in the background
