# Azure Cosmos DB

### What Cosmos DB?
- A globally distributed, multi-model database server

### Features
1. Significantly more powerful and feature rich than Azure Storage Tables
2. Low latency
3. Highly available
4. Elastic scalability
5. Multi-modal
6. Provides single-digit-millisecond data access
7. Supports several API surfaces including: SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Table and Gremlin

### The CAP Theorem
1. Consistency - Each read operation returns the latest data (or an error)
2. Availability - Each request receives a valid response; however, may be actually contain the latest write
3. Partition Tolerance - The system continues to function even if packets are dropped or there is latency 
- Note however, you can only have 2 of the above 3
4. Cosmos DB can be configured using any 2 combination mentioned above
